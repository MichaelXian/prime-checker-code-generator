# prime-checker-code-generator
Possibly over-engineered code that generates a prime checker. Currently running the code generator to guarantee correctness for all integers.

Update:
The file is somewhat larget than expected and cannot be put on github. Additionally, it is also too large to fit on my computer. I will upload a 100MB version at one point that unfortunately cannot guarantee correctness for all integers.
